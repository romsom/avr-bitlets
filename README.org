* Jam Multi Clock
This hardware project is about a device which let's you sync different pieces of synth hardware, like e.g., Teenage Engineering Pocket Operators, MIDI devices like the Mutable Instruments Shruthi-1 and the Arturia Beat Step Pro.

* Implementation
The first step will just be to implement clock conversion from the Beatstep Pro to the Pocket Operator (and possibly back).
